      "content": "Omg what a great place to stay. The communication between Art and Jason was outstanding they kept in touch with you the whole step of the way. The location was perfect walking distance to everything. The inside of condo 806 was awesome they had everything you needed to cook if you wanted to, instructions on everything was very helpful. The bed was very comfortable. Went to the beach everyday and they had nice BIG heavy duty beach towels and comfortable chairs they have an umbrella also but we didn't have enough hands to carry, short walking distance to restaurants and food trucks which are a must to eat at. Never had a problem with parking came home late every night and there was always enough parking. OMG the views from this condo are amazing also sitting on the patio having breakfast and coffee on the nice bar top patio set can't get better than this. Don't hesitate to stay here you won't be disappointed. Thank you Art and Jason for everything.",
